# SQLite Configuration

SQLite is perfect for development, testing, and small-scale applications. It requires no separate database server and stores data in a single file.

## Connection String Examples

### File-Based Database

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "DatabaseContext": "Data Source=AuthScape.db"
  }
}
```

### Full Path

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "DatabaseContext": "Data Source=C:\\Data\\AuthScape.db"
  }
}
```

### In-Memory Database

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "DatabaseContext": "Data Source=:memory:"
  }
}
```

### Shared In-Memory (Multiple Connections)

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "DatabaseContext": "Data Source=AuthScape;Mode=Memory;Cache=Shared"
  }
}
```

## Connection String Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Data Source` | File path or `:memory:` | `AuthScape.db`, `:memory:` |
| `Mode` | Open mode | `ReadWriteCreate`, `ReadWrite`, `ReadOnly`, `Memory` |
| `Cache` | Cache sharing mode | `Default`, `Shared`, `Private` |
| `Password` | Encryption password | `mypassword` |

## Use Cases

### Development
SQLite is ideal for local development:
- No database server required
- Fast setup
- Easy to reset (just delete the file)
- Works offline

### Testing
Use in-memory SQLite for fast unit tests:

```csharp
services.AddAuthScapeDatabase("Data Source=:memory:");
```

### Small Applications
Suitable for:
- Prototypes and demos
- Single-user applications
- Embedded systems
- Mobile backends with low traffic

## Limitations

SQLite has some limitations compared to SQL Server or PostgreSQL:

- **Concurrency:** Limited write concurrency
- **No network access:** File must be local
- **No stored procedures:** Limited SQL features
- **Size limits:** Practical limit around 1TB

## Best Practices

1. **Don't use for production** with high concurrency
2. **Use full paths** to avoid file location issues
3. **Backup regularly** - it's just a file
4. **Use WAL mode** for better concurrency:

```json
"Data Source=AuthScape.db;Pooling=True;Mode=ReadWriteCreate"
```

## Database File Location

By default, relative paths are relative to the application's working directory. For ASP.NET Core apps, this is typically the project root in development.

```csharp
// Get the full path programmatically
var dbPath = Path.Combine(
    Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData),
    "AuthScape",
    "data.db"
);
```

## Migrations

SQLite migrations work the same as other providers:

```bash
# Generate migration
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

# Apply to database
dotnet ef database update
```

The database file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
