# CRM Integration

AuthScape provides built-in support for bidirectional synchronization with popular CRM systems. This allows you to keep your user data in sync between AuthScape and external CRM platforms.

## Supported CRM Providers

- **Microsoft Dynamics 365** - Full support for contacts and accounts
- **Salesforce** - Coming soon
- **HubSpot** - Coming soon
- **Google Contacts** - Coming soon

## Features

### Bidirectional Sync

Changes made in either system are automatically synchronized:

- **Outbound Sync**: When users are created or updated in AuthScape, changes are pushed to your CRM
- **Inbound Sync**: When contacts are modified in your CRM, changes are pulled into AuthScape

### Field Mapping

Configure which AuthScape user fields map to which CRM fields. The system supports:

- Standard fields (name, email, phone)
- Custom fields defined in your CRM
- Transformation rules for data conversion

### Real-time Updates

Set up webhooks to receive instant notifications when CRM records change, enabling real-time synchronization without polling.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **User Management > CRM Integration** in the admin portal
2. Click **Add Connection** to configure your CRM provider
3. Set up entity mappings (e.g., User → Contact)
4. Configure field mappings for each entity
5. Enable the connection to start syncing

      "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
      "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
      "Environment": "your-org.crm.dynamics.com"
